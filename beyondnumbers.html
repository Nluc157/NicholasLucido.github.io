                    <h2>Beyond the Numbers</h2>
                    <h3>Ruminating on the interpretation of statistical evidence and personal bias.</h3>
                </header>

                <p>The search engine on our computers is a portal into vast worlds of information, all interconnected by
                    the binary language of the computer. As I sat down to complete my first exploratory data analysis, I
                    immediately felt overwhelmed by this fact, and wondered where to begin. While I am new to the world of
                    data analytics, my query history boasts quite the resume - no pun intended. I have been using the
                    search engine since the turn of the century, looking into some of the many thoughts bubbling in my
                    head, throughout the different seasons of my childhood, teen, and adult years.</p>

                <p>Interest in science has helped guide much of my decision making in life, as I use the Internet today to
                    learn more about the topics that fascinate me and help to bring value to my life. However, different
                    scientific studies can seemingly portray contradictory results, and one must always be careful and
                    mindful about making conclusions from any articles, studies, media, or other sources of information.
                </p>

                <p>In a recent statistical class, the ongoing debate regarding the significance of the p-value was brought
                    to my attention, and the potential for researchers to use this value to misinterpret and oversimplify
                    the results of their hypothesis test. Using p-values as the end all be all on judgements of
                    statistical significance seems to me to be oversimplifying potential underlying mechanisms, and in
                    turn making interpretations overly black and white. The human condition is too nuanced to be
                    completely defined by conditional statements or tests of significance.</p>

                <p>As I ruminated about the dataset I wished to explore, I wondered about the issue of 'interpretation'
                    regarding statistical results. Knowing which tests may be appropriate to run is one thing, but how
                    one interprets their results to draw meaningful, practical insights is another. It makes me think
                    about human awareness, and how we can derive different meanings and perceptions from the same
                    situations depending on our viewpoints, and personal bias.</p>

                <p>Hence, I believe in never jumping to conclusions and no matter how much I learn about the data, I
                    believe it's important to still be aware of the hidden intricacies that may have gone unnoticed. More
                    so, of any possible misinterpretation of the data and its ensuing connections between variables.
                    While the p-value may suggest that the association between two categories of data is likely occurring
                    beyond random chance, the interpretation of that potential association is certainly not a binary
                    reality.</p>

                <p>If two people can see the same event in different lights, than certainly scientists will and do have
                    different viewpoints on the interpretation of scientific results. The bias that we bring to life has
                    the potential to cloud how we explain the meaning of our results. Thus, the importance of remaining
                    skeptical, yet open-minded to new possibilities and discoveries, from where the fruits of science
                    may be reaped.</p>

                <p>To me, the ultimate task within data analysis lies in being able to ask the right questions. The
                    objective must be clearly defined, or else one may become lost in an endless array of meaningless,
                    random associations or coincidences. Finding the problem that will lead to the most advantageous
                    outcomes is paramount in achieving the most worthwhile results, which may turn out to be what one
                    has not expected. The ability to remain detached from outcomes is key in limiting the bias one brings
                    to the exploration of data.</p>

                <p>As I continue my journey into the immense world of data analytics and science, I develop a personal
                    mantra to remind myself to remain grounded in the essential elements of curiosity and refinement, as
                    surely untold stories remain. Learning the tools of the trade is one thing, but asking the right
                    questions which may lead to data-driven decisions that drive actionable results is another. By
                    remaining open-minded to new possibilities, I aim to continually refine my statistical techniques,
                    all the while staying receptive to the potential subjective nature inherent in various components of
                    analysis.</p>
